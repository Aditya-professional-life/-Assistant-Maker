# AI Assistant Project

## Overview

This project is an advanced AI assistant capable of performing various tasks such as describing images, extracting and explaining clipboard text, taking screenshots, and interacting through a chatbot. The assistant leverages multiple libraries and APIs, including Groq and Google Generative AI, to provide comprehensive and intelligent assistance.

## Features

- **Image Description**: Captures images from the webcam or screenshots and provides detailed descriptions.
- **Clipboard Text Explanation**: Extracts text from the clipboard and provides explanations or summaries.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots and processes them for detailed analysis.
- **Chatbot Interaction**: Interacts with users through a chatbot using Groq and Google Generative AI.

## Libraries Used

- **os**: Provides operating system-related functionality.
- **time**: Handles time-related tasks.
- **re**: Facilitates regular expression operations.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Manages image processing tasks.
- **cv2 (OpenCV)**: Performs computer vision tasks, including webcam image capture.
- **pyperclip**: Facilitates clipboard operations.
- **pyttsx3**: Converts text to speech.
- **speech_recognition**: Handles speech recognition tasks.
- **faster_whisper (WhisperModel)**: Transcribes audio using the Whisper model.
- **Groq**: Manages chatbot interactions.
- **google.generativeai**: Handles interactions with Google's Generative AI for content creation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-assistant-project.git
    cd ai-assistant-project
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Set up your API keys for Groq and Google Generative AI. Replace the placeholders in the code with your actual API keys:
    ```python
    groq_client = Groq(api_key="your_groq_api_key")
    genai.configure(api_key="your_google_generative_ai_key")
    ```

2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Choose your input mode (voice or text) and interact with the assistant by providing prompts.
